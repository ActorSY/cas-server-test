# This file only serves a template that outlines the list of properties
# may have to be declared inside the cas.properties file, not only to
# configure ldap authentication, but also enable and configure the lppe feature.
#

# == General connection settings ==

# Search filter when using a search-and-bind strategy.
ldap.authentication.filter=sAMAccountName=%u

# Directory URL. Only one URL should be supplied.
# For deployments that need HA directory connections, hardware load balancing with a
# single virtual host is the only reasonable solution.
ldap.authentication.server.urls=ldap://1.1.1.1

# Base DN for directory searches.
ldap.authentication.basedn=cn=users,dc=school,dc=edu

# Manager credentials to bind; only used for searches.
# Only required by directories that prevent anonymous queries (e.g. AD) when performing
# a search-and-bind authentication strategy.
ldap.authentication.manager.userdn=cn=manager,cn=users,dc=school,dc=edu
ldap.authentication.manager.password=password

# Strongly recommended for AD.
ldap.authentication.ignorePartialResultException=true

ldap.authentication.jndi.connect.timeout=3000
ldap.authentication.jndi.read.timeout=3000
ldap.authentication.jndi.security.level=simple

# == Connection pooling settings ==

ldap.authentication.pool.minIdle=3
ldap.authentication.pool.maxIdle=5
ldap.authentication.pool.maxSize=10

# Maximum time in ms to wait for connection to become available
# under pool exhausted condition.
ldap.authentication.pool.maxWait=10000

# == Evictor configuration ==

# Period in ms at which evictor process runs.
ldap.authentication.pool.evictionPeriod=600000

# Maximum time in ms at which connections can remain idle before
# they become liable to eviction.
ldap.authentication.pool.idleTime=1200000

# == Connection testing settings ==

# Set to true to enable connection liveliness testing on evictor
# process runs.  Probably results in best performance.
ldap.authentication.pool.testWhileIdle=true

# Set to true to enable connection liveliness testing before every
# request to borrow an object from the pool.
ldap.authentication.pool.testOnBorrow=false
